## Introduction

In this project, we are going to obtain conclusions analyzing and processing large datasets, which
could help the company drive its business using its own data. We are choosing Airbnb for this
project. Airbnb was founded in 2008, is a global travel community helping people find a place to
stay anywhere in the world. It uniquely utilizes technology to economically empower millions of
people around to world. They help house owners monetize their spaces, passion and talent to
become entrepreneurs. With a global reach


## Technologies/Tools

## Project Goals
### Where to invest in property to get more profit?
We are adding feature which will help the host to have idea about the property investment. In
this we are suggesting the different areas which can be best fit for the investor to make properties
available to make more profit, which include what type of property, number of beds etc. These
suggestions are based on the different parameter like, property type, number of beds, security
deposit, cleaning fees, average price of the property. To achieve this prediction of location we
are using different machine learning models varies in supervised category.

### What price to have for new property listing?
Average price prediction: Prices of properties on Airbnb vary based on the kind of facilities
provided, type of property, the location of the property, and time of booking. Since the platform
is extremely competitive, new property owners should be able to list their property at a right
price to be in business. If the price is quoted high, chances are that the opening business might
be dull, which could demotivate the property owner. At the same time, if the property prices are
listed very low, the owners could be missing out on some profits that could be theirs.
We will create a machine learning based solution that will help owners decide an approximate
price that they must be quoting for their property. This solution could be used internally by
Airbnb to audit and regulate prices of properties already listed too.

### When to plan a trip to get the deal in Price?
We have analyzed the Airbnb New York city data from the data set to come up with visual graph
and metrics that would help customer to plan his stay at Airbnb so one can get the best deal.
Results of the analysis includes graphs and some recommendation for the customer. Analysis
results points out what is the maximum average price for given listing and the reason for the
observed increase in price i.e. if it was a holiday or a weekend.
